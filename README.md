# AI Agent for Postgres using Azure AI Agent Service

This project demonstrates how to build an AI agent that can analyze SaaS usage data stored in a Neon Serverless Postgres database and explain billing anomalies in natural language using Azure AI Agent Service.

## ‚ú® Why this project?
- No need for complex frameworks like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or AutoGen
- Leverages Azure AI Foundry's built-in agent orchestration
- Connects to a real Postgres backend (Neon) to fetch and analyze data
- Beginner-friendly setup with clear steps

## üß† Use Case
Imagine you run a SaaS platform and want to:
- Spot billing spikes (e.g., sudden API call increases)
- Ask natural questions like: *"Why did my bill go up this week?"*
- Get AI-powered insights directly from your usage database

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription -¬†[Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services).
- Make sure you have the¬†**Azure AI Developer**¬†[RBAC role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry)¬†assigned
- Install¬†[Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a **Neon Database on Azure**

Open the¬†[new Neon Resource page](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Azure_Marketplace_Neon/NeonCreateResource.ReactView)¬†on the Azure portal, and it brings up the form to create a Neon Serverless Postgres Resource. Fill out the form with the required fields and deploy it. 

#### Obtain Neon Database Credentials

1. After the resource is created, go to the Neon Serverless Postgres Organization service and click on the Portal URL. This brings you to the Neon Console
2. Click ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù
3. Choose an Azure region
4. Give your project a name (e.g., ‚ÄúPostgres AI Agent‚Äù)
5. Click ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù
6. Once the project is created successfully, copy the Neon connection string and note down. You can find the connection details in the Connection Details widget on the Neon Dashboard.

```bash
    postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require
```

### 2. Create an AI Foundry Project on Azure

Create a new hub and project in the Azure AI Foundry portal by [following the guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#create-a-hub-and-project-in-azure-ai-foundry-portal) in the Microsoft docs. You also need to [deploy a model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#deploy-a-model) like GPT-4o. 

You only need the **Project connection string** and **Model Deployment Name** from the Azure AI Foundry portal. You can also find your connection string in the¬†**overview**¬†for your project in the¬†[**Azure AI Foundry portal**](https://ai.azure.com/), under¬†**Project details**¬†>¬†**Project connection string**.

Once you have all three values on hand: **Neon connection string**, **Project connection string,** and **Model Deployment Name,** you are ready to set up the Python project to create an Agent.

### 3. Clone the repo and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/billing-anomaly-agent.git
cd billing-anomaly-agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create the .env file

```env
PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="<Your AI Foundry connection string>"
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=""
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING="<Your Neon connection string>"
```

### 5. Load sample data into Neon
```bash
python init_usage_data.py
```

### 6. Run the agent
```bash
python billing_anomaly_agent.py
```

## üß™ Test Your Agent in the Playground
1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) ‚Üí **Agents**
2. Select your billing agent
3. Use the playground to ask:
   - "Why did tenant_456 have a spike in API usage?"
   - "What happened with storage for tenant_789 last week?"

## üßº Cleanup (Optional)
Delete the agent from your script or the Azure portal after testing:
```python
project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
```
